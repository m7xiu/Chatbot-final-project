When the story ends, the little prince has chosen to leave earth and return to his planet. He does so by enlisting the help of a poisonous snake, the same snake he met earlier in his travels. He allows himself to be bitten and he prepares to leave his body. The pilot is distraught and tries to save the little prince. He fails.
The pilot then comes to realize that something his little friend told him in the very beginning of the book is true: If you love something, sometimes just knowing it exists is enough to make you happy. The pilot looks up at the stars and knows that somewhere out there, the little prince is back at home, on his own little planet, tenderly caring for his beautiful flower. He wonders about the sheep they both feared might eat it. He thinks to himself how important it is to ask oneself that very question: has the sheep eaten the flower? The story ends as the pilot says to himself "no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!"
